README file for DALM/PALM and Homotopy l1-minimization code
by Victor Shia, Allen Yang

================================

Homotopy and DALM Code solves the following problem:
min ||x||_1 s.t. b = Ax

There are two versions of the DALM code, fast and regular (matlab files included).

PALM Code solves the following problems:
min ||x||_1 + ||e||_1 s.t. b = Ax+e

================================

Two methods to make:

(1) In matlab:
mex <name> -I<util directory> -lmwblas -lmwlapack -DCOMPILE_MEX -DBLAS_IMPLEMENTATION_MATLAB -DCOMPILE_MEX


(2) Using g++ (in the Makefile)
Currently, there exist wrappers for the BLAS/LAPACK libraries for the ACML and MATLAB libraries.
to use them, in the Makefile, add -DBLAS_IMPLEMENTATION_<ACML or MATLAB> to the compile commands
Be sure to also include the header and library files for the corresponding libraries.

Notes:  
(1) MATLAB libraries use a subset of Intel MKL's libraries, which are optimized for Intel Processors and can utilize multiple cores, unlike ACML libraries.
I didn't write wrappers for the MKL libraries, but to increase performance, the user may want to use Intel MKL's libraries.
(2) ACML libraries do NOT exist for Mac OSX

================================

test.m, test_random.cpp are just scripts to verify the output of the code in matlab and in C
